# HeadRipper
Headspace Downloader

# Why
I'm not an a Headspace user, but I was dissapointed that you could not use a PC or even a web browser to listen to a majority of their library. 
This program will allow me to bring access to those who want to try Headspace but either don't have a mobile device or don't have access to their device during the night.

# Versions

## Browser Extensions
Chrome and Firefox have dedicated extensions that will add a small button to Headspace to download whatever audio you have open. It will organize the files by title, and each file will have the narrator's name and audio length (if applicable)

# Disclaimer
By making this program I am not promoting piracy or stealing of content from Headspace. 
They truely believe in what they create and that should be supported for making a service that helps
many many people every day. Nothing in this program allows a person to access content they do not have explicit permissions to access!

# Bearer ID
You will notice in a few places a BearerID mentioned. This is the authentication key that Headspace uses to make sure you are a registered user and you have the rights to the media you are listening to! Headripper will read this BearerID to formulate it's API requests, but it does not track or send this anywhere except Headspace directly.
